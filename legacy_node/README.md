Installation

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed (from python.org). For MySQL, install a server like XAMPP or MariaDB for local development.
Database Setup:

Start your MySQL server.
Access phpMyAdmin (usually at http://localhost/phpmyadmin) or use a MySQL client.
Create a new database named cashier_db.
Run the database.sql script to create tables (e.g., users, products, customers, sales), or let the Flask app initialize them on first run.
Update database credentials in .env if they differ (e.g., MYSQL_HOST=localhost, MYSQL_USER=root, MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password).


Python Dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt in the project root to install Flask, SQLAlchemy, and other libraries.
Environment Setup: Copy the provided .env file and fill in your MySQL credentials and FLASK_SECRET_KEY (generate a strong random string).
Start the App: Run python app.py for the full-stack server (handles both backend API and frontend serving). Access the app at http://localhost:5000 (or your configured PORT).

Getting Started

Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser for the login page.
Register an initial user via the register section (defaults to 'owner' role; admins can be added later via the Admin panel).
Use phpMyAdmin or a MySQL client to monitor or edit the database directly.

Legacy Node.js Version
The original Node.js backend has been backed up in /legacy-node/ for reference. This Flask port maintains full API compatibility for seamless frontend integration.
